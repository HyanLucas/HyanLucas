<h1>Hello there, I'm Hyan Lucas</h1>

<p>I'm a 24-year-old man from Brazil and I'm very interested in biology and technology. I began programming in the middle of 2021 and have been studying machine learning and data science since the beginning of 2023. My objective now is to obtain an internship and improve my skills in English and coding, particularly with Python and Java.</p>
<br>
<p>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently searching for an internship.</p>
<p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things Python, MySQL, Machine Learning, and Data Science.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Python/Java projects to practice my code skills.</p>
<p>ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Machine Learning and Data Science projects, I'm new to this technology and some advice about them would help.</p>
<p>ðŸ¤– You can find me on Kaggle too: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hyanlucas">Kaggle</a></p>
